# NFTDAO
A self governing platform where people can vote and buy fractions of NFTs 

## Purpose/the problem it solves
There are many expensive NFTs with great utility but people are unable to invest due to high floor price and many times due to enormous amount of existing projects people are unable to identify an opportunity hence this DAO will help people own fraction of NFT by having a common treasury for investors and find new opportunities by passing new proposals, investing and essentially self governing.

## Overview 
This projects consists of two smart contracts written in Solidity NFTDAOtoken and NFTDAO, NFTDAOtoken is an ERC20 token which will be used for voting on the DAO and NFTDAO is the governance contract featuring passing proposals and voting.

## Use cases 
Users can directly view details of an NFT collections through the native platform's home page where they can view price action, floor-price, attributes, rarity, volume and other details of a collection. Any user can pass a proposal to buy NFT(s). The voting duration will be 5 days long and if there are more than 75% of investors in favour then the proposal will pass.
